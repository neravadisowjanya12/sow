                <p>Ayurveda is a natural health care system that emphasizes the treatment 
                    of disease in a highly individualized manner as it believes that every 
                    individual is unique having a different constitution. It classifies all 
                    individuals into different 'Prakruti' types based on the theory of tridosha
                     and each type has a varying degree of predisposition to different diseases.
                      This is independent of racial, ethnic, or geographical considerations. Knowing
                       which particular Prakruti one belongs to, enables them to decide the preference 
                       of food which suits them best. By following the rules and regulations regarding 
                       food and lifestyle, one can prevent themselves from getting inflicted with various 
                       diseases. But, Prakruti assessment is a tedious process that requires the individual 
                       to visit the physician followed by a long list of questions in order to reach a conclusion. 
                       In order to make this process more convenient, the development of a self- assessment tool with 
                       the help of artificial intelligence may prove to be a stepping stone. A Chatbot which has pre-recorded
                        questionnaire may help in the Prakruti
                    assessment depending upon the responses given by an individual.</p>
